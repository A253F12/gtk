 * GskPathPoint:

 * tangent or its curvature.

 * To obtain a `GskPathPoint`, use [method@Gsk.Path.get_closest_point].

 * Note that `GskPathPoint` structs are meant to be stack-allocated, and
 * don't a reference to the path object they are obtained from. It is the
 * callers responsibility to keep a reference to the path as long as the
 * `GskPathPoint` is used.
