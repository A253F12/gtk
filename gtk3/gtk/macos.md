Title: Using GTK on macOS

# Using GTK on macOS

The macOS port of GTK is an implementation of GDK (and therefore GTK) on top
of the Quarz API.

Currently, the macOS port does not use any additional commandline options or
environment variables.

For up-to-date information about the current status of this port, see the
[project page](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GTK+/OSX).
