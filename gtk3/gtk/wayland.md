Title: Using GTK with Wayland

# Using GTK with Wayland

The GDK Wayland backend provides support for running GTK applications under
the Wayland display server. To run your application in this way, select the
Wayland backend by setting `GDK_BACKEND=wayland` in your environment.

Currently, the Wayland backend does not use any additional commandline
options or environment variables.

For up-to-date information about the current status of this backend, see [the
project page](https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland/GTK%2B).
